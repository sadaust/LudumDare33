# LudumDare33
Ludum Dare 33 Jam
Theme: You are the Monster

Starting with the game engine from Elimbination as the base for this project.
The idea I have for the game is you start out small then by eating things you get bigger and bigger.
The things in the game would be small animals, people and buildings. You start out eating the small animals then you go for people, then you start attacking buildings so you can eat the rubble and eventualy be able to eat a full building.
